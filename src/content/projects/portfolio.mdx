## Usage

### Content Management with MDX and Contentlayer

#### MDX

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. It allows for the seamless integration of React components within markdown files, providing rich content creation capabilities. In this project, MDX files are used to create content for various sections of the portfolio site, such as project descriptions, blog posts, and about me sections.

#### Contentlayer

Contentlayer is a tool that enables the use of markdown (MDX) files as a source of truth for content in Next.js projects. It allows you to define content schemas using a simple YAML syntax and automatically generates TypeScript types for your content. Contentlayer seamlessly integrates with Next.js, providing a streamlined workflow for managing content in your applications.

To use Contentlayer in this project, simply create MDX files in the `content` directory and define your content schemas in the `contentlayer.config.ts` file. Contentlayer will parse these files and make the content available in your Next.js components, allowing you to dynamically render content on your site.
